                SoldierTrack is a platform dedicated to supporting athletes in their daily routines by tracking workouts,
                progressive overload, and calorie intake.
                It also offers memberships that athletes can purchase to join our CrossFit workouts at our facility.

                Our membership pricing is published under the request membership form.

                You do not need an active membership to access them.

                Our admin team will approve your request during regular working hours.
                If your request is submitted outside these hours, it will be processed on the next working day.
                For example, if you request your membership on October 10th but it is approved on October 11th,
                the start date will be considered October 11th.

                Yes, you can create your own exercises. This happens from the 'Create Exercise' button in the menu.
                When you search for exercises, you'll see an 'Include mine' checkbox.
                Check this option to include your custom exercises in the search results.

            <p>
                Yes, every registered user can view all exercises, including custom ones, and create achievements from them.
                They need to check the 'Include custom' checkbox next to the search bar to see these exercises in the results.
                However, only you (and admin, if necessary) can edit or delete them.

                Yes, and the rules are the same as those for creating a custom exercise.

        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
                The <strong>'custom'</strong> label indicates that the food or exercise was added by a user, not by our team.
                This means it may contain incorrect or inaccurate information, especially for foods.
                Users can edit their custom entries, including macronutrient details, which could result in inaccuracies in your logs.
            </p>
            <p>
                We strongly recommend using only <strong>'approved'</strong> foods and exercises,
                as these have been created and verified by our team for accuracy and support.
                Our database is extensive, so you're likely to find what you need.
                However, if you don’t, you’re always welcome to create your own custom entry.
            </p>
            <p>
                To ensure that no custom foods or exercises appear in your search results,
                simply leave the <strong>'Include custom'</strong> checkbox unchecked when searching.

            <p>
                Yes, you cannot create more than <strong>50</strong> custom exercises.
                The same limit applies to custom foods.
                However, you likely won't need to reach that limit.

                You can create food diaries for any date within a range of one month in the past to one month in the future.
                It's also important to note that SoldierTrack retains food diary data for up to one year.
