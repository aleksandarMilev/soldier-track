## Getting Started

To run the application locally using Docker:

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed and running

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aleksandarMilev/soldier-track
cd soldier-track
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the root directory (you can use the .env-sample as skeleton). It should be something like this:

```bash
ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development

CONNECTION_STRING_PASSWORD=!Passw0rd

SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USERNAME=foo@mail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=foo

ADMIN_EMAIL=foo@boo.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=bar

```

### 3. Run the app

Use Docker Compose to start the application and the SQL Server database:

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

The application should be available at **http://localhost:8080**

### 4. (_Optional_) Run the tests

Simply run `dotnet test` from the project root.

Known issues:

- Grafana does not visualize HTTP Requests Rate
- All images are saved as URLs at the database (except the static ones, they are saved as files at `/www.root`). This is not ideal. It will be better to keep them as files too.
- There are a few unit tests and not integration tests at all.
- The code itself is not commented at all (add XML comments, especially in the service interfaces and the extension methods for the web project).
- The application does not have any logging, which makes troubleshooting a nightmare.
